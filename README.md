# knights-travails

### Description
This project was made while following along the odin project. The purpose of this project was to use a search algorithm to find the shortest path from the
starting point to the end point.

### How to use
- Copy and paste code either in your browser's console or a file in your chosen IDE
- Change the starting position and/or end position in the knightMove function(ie. knightMove(startingPoint, endPoint)). The positions should be an array of numbers that are within the board space
- The console should respond with the number of moves taken and all the squares it stepped on
